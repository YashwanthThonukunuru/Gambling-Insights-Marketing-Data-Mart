# Gambling-Insights-Marketing-Data-Mart
 
This project is focused on deriving marketing insights from data collected from an online gambling website. The primary goal of this project is to create a comprehensive marketing data mart that provides valuable information on customer behavior and trends. In addition, I've developed an interactive R Shiny application for exploring these insights.

## Data

The data originates from the collaborative research initiative between the Division on Addictions (DOA) and bwin Interactive Entertainment, AG (bwin), an Internet betting service provider. The dataset covers the period from February 2005 to September 2005 and includes demographic information, betting transactions, and poker chip conversions.

## Project Goals

1. **Basic Marketing Descriptives:**
   Provide descriptive insights about the customer base, including demographics, origin, and average age.

2. **Marketing Data Mart:**
   Create a marketing data mart per customer, aggregating key marketing metrics such as loyalty, consumption, and more.

3. **Interactive R Shiny Application:**
   Develop an R Shiny application that enables users to interactively explore the marketing data and metrics.

## Output

The repository includes the following outputs:

- R scripts with comments detailing data processing and insights generation.
- The marketing data mart and overall summary statistics.
- An interactive R Shiny application offering dynamic exploration of marketing insights.
